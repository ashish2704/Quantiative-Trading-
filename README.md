# Trading with Momentum Project
In this project, I implemented implement a momentum trading strategy and tested to see if it has the potential to be profitable.  A universe of stocks and time range was used. A textual decription of strategy is provided. Trading signal was  computed  for the time range given and appled  to the dataset to produce projected returns. Finally, a statistical test on the mean of the returns was done to conclude if there is alpha in the signal. For the dataset,  the end of day datas was used from Quotemedia.

# Breakout Strategy Project
In this project, I implemented a breakout strategy.  The strategy is  test to see if it has the potential to be profitable using a Histogram and P-Value. For the dataset,  the end of day datas was used from Quotemedia.

# Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization
In this project, I built a smart beta portfolio and compared it to a benchmark index. To find out how well the smart beta portfolio did, I calculated the tracking error against the index. Then built a portfolio by using quadratic programming to optimize the weights. code  rebalanced this portfolio and calculated turn over to evaluate the performance. I used this metric to find the optimal rebalancing Frequency. For the dataset,  the end of day datas was used from Quotemedia.

# Alpha research and multi factor modeling
In this project, I built a statistical risk model using PCA. I use this model to build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors. I created these factors, then evaluated them using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. At the end of the project, I  optimized the portfolio using the risk model and factors using multiple optimization formulations. For the dataset,  the end of day datas was used from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.
